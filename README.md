Your purpose audience and goal was defined and thought out. Combining both photography and web development portfolios is a great idea and I cant wait to see the results. That being said be careful of scope creep. I would also recomend spending extra time thinking about how you want to layout your portfolio section. You might want to consider having one or two more extra pages but no more than four. The use case could have used a little more work. I would recomend spending more time documenting how your persona interacted with the site. Your HTML and directory structure was also perfect

Your breakdown of each section is incredibly thorough, which is excellent. Not only did you spell nearly every detail out in words, but the wireframe is very detailed as well. Extra kudos for being so detail oriented.

One thing that I noticed on your mobile wireframe is the horizontal nav menu, as opposed to using a dropdown button. If you prefer the horizontal menu on mobile that's fine, but we typically recommend avoiding larger nav menus on mobile sites, due to lack of useable space. 

According to [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~dmartin61%2Fpersonal-website%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-2.php) you're missing a `lang="en"` attribute on your `<html>` tag. While this isn't required, it's recommended to assist screen readers, and the visually impaired. The Validator also pointed out that you're using `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no">`. While that tag is necessary, the attributes `maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no` are going to hurt your user experience. It's recommended to remove these two attributes from your meta tag to allow zooming in and out.

Overall your html is spot on, your directory structure is looking good and I think your PWP is going to come out looking great. The detail you've put into your descriptions and wireframes is going to make things a lot easier on you as class progresses.
